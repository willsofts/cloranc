#Athiti Font

The objective of this project is to create an informal Sans Latin & Loopless Thai typeface. Athiti, a sans serif typeface family with a friendly personality based on humanist calligraphy, has an organic look and feel while preserving the traditional construction of Roman typography. It all started with a desire to learn more about the origin of strokes on human handwriting. Its unparalled outline and inline is designed on purpose to reflect a trace of writing tools as related to the handwriting inspiration. The family consists of 6 weights that can be used as headline or body text.
